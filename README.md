# MMDA-Project

This was my final project for [CMSC 424: Database Design](http://cs.umd.edu/class/fall2017/cmsc424-0101/).

The project consisted of a MySQL database and a front end for users to interact with.  
The site allowed users to upload various forms of media(images, video, audio etc.) either from their local drive or by URL.
Uploaded files had there metadata extracted and stored in the database.

The website allowed users to perform queries on he data and other features such as organize data into catagories.

Extensive documentation was produced throughout all steps of development.  For a full explanation of the system, including how to implement it locally, [please view the formal report](https://github.com/franktiburzi/MMDA-Project/blob/master/424%20-FinalReport.pdf).
